## 1. Buster Posey MVP Dataset (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/buster-poseys-pitch-framing-makes-him-a-potential-mvp/)
**Questions:**
- What made Buster Posey's framing that much more valuable then other players?
- Is there a relationship between framing and winning, or just framing and defense?
    - To make this question better, i could write a code that looks for stats in the csv for his stats in games that Posey was a good framer, and then find another csv file on games that he won and make an operator that would return true if posey had a game where he was a good framer and the giants won, and would return false if both of those stipulations failed
